# FileCountUI

This is a small lazarus program showing the count of add (or delete) files of a folder since start or last reset.
It's very KISS, only a timer for updating every second. On Doubleclick of the Counter, the counter will reset. You can configure this in any way. Simple put the executable into the folder you want to watch and start it. Thats all.

Have fun.
